# Mastering Python Basics

# REPL = Read-Eval-Print Loop
# REPL is a simple interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user.
# It is a simple way to test code snippets and get immediate feedback.
# It is commonly used in programming languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.
# In Python, you can use the REPL by opening a terminal and typing `python` or `python3` to enter the interactive mode.
# You can then type Python code and see the results immediately.
# For example, you can type `print("Hello, World!")` and see the output right away.
# The REPL is a great way to experiment with code and learn how to use a programming language.
# It allows you to test small pieces of code without having to write a complete program.
# You can also use the REPL to debug code by testing small pieces of code and seeing how they behave.

# Clone the repository to the computer:
# git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository.git

# Navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned:
# cd YourRepository

# Create a new branch (optional but good practice):
# git checkout -b new-feature-branch

# Save and stage changes:
# git add .
# git commit -m "Add new feature or fix bug"

# Push to GitHub:
# git push origin new-feature-branch

# Pull to GitHub:
# git pull origin new-feature-branch
# or
# Create a pull request on GitHub:
# Go to your repository on GitHub, and you should see an option to create a pull request for the new branch you just pushed.
# Click on "New Pull Request" and follow the instructions to create a pull request.
# Once the pull request is created, you can review the changes, add comments, and merge it into the main branch if everything looks good.
# Basic Commands for Navigating Directories in the Terminal
# cd <directory_name> to change to a specific directory
# cd - to change to the previous directory
# cd ~ to change to the home directory
# cd / to change to the root directory
# cd .. to change to the parent directory
# cd . to change to the current directory
# ls to list the contents of the current directory
# ls -l to list the contents of the current directory in long format
# ls -a to list all files, including hidden files, in the current directory
# ls -lh to list the contents of the current directory in long format with human-readable file sizes
# pwd to print the current working directory
# mkdir <directory_name> to create a new directory
# rmdir <directory_name> to remove an empty directory
# rm -r <directory_name> to remove a directory and its contents recursively
# cp <source> <destination> to copy a file or directory
# mv <source> <destination> to move or rename a file or directory
# touch <file_name> to create a new empty file
# cat <file_name> to display the contents of a file
# echo <text> to print text to the terminal
# clear to clear the terminal screen
# history to display the command history
# exit to exit the terminal

# to check your remotes
# git remote -v

# Add your remote (replace URL with your actual repo URL):
# git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

# now push your changes to the remote repository:
# git push origin emmanuel

# or
# echo "# AI-ML-Predictor" >> README.md
# git init
# git add README.md
# git commit -m "first commit"
# git branch -M main
# git remote add origin https://github.com/Emmydantoch/AI-ML-Predictor.git
# git push -u origin main


# To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use        

#     git push --set-upstream origin main
