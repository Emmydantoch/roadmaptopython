#py -m pip install requests # This command installs the requests library using Python's package manager, pip.

# py -m pip list # This command lists all installed packages in the current Python environment.
# py -m pip freeze # This command outputs a list of installed packages and their versions in a format suitable for requirements files.

#py -m pip install requests==2.31.0 # This command installs a specific version (2.31.0) of the requests library using pip.


#py -m pip install -u requests # This command updates the requests library to the latest version available in the Python Package Index (PyPI).

# py -m pip install requests --upgrade # This command upgrades the requests library to the latest version available in the Python Package Index (PyPI). 

#py -m pip uninstall requests # This command uninstalls the requests library from the current Python environment.

#py -m venv venv # This command creates a new virtual environment named "venv" in the current directory.

#source .venv/Scripts/activate # This command activates the virtual environment created by the previous command, allowing you to work within that isolated environment.

#deactivate # This command deactivates the currently active virtual environment, returning you to the system's default Python environment.

#pip list # This command lists all installed packages in the current Python environment, showing their names and versions

#pip show requests # This command displays detailed information about the requests library, including its version, author, license, and dependencies.

#pip install requests --no-cache-dir # This command installs the requests library without using the cache, ensuring that the latest version is downloaded directly from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

# py -m pip freeze > requirements.txt # This command generates a requirements file named "requirements.txt" that lists all installed packages and their versions in the current Python environment. This file can be used to recreate the environment later.


#.gitignore # This file is used to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git version control. It helps keep the repository clean by excluding unnecessary files, such as virtual environment directories, compiled files, and sensitive information.
